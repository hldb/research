## Review Template

Each review must start with a table:

Title | \<Document Title> |
---|---|
Link | \<link to pdf or site that includes link to pdf if available> |
DOI | \<DOI> |
Categories | \<any categories the paper is relevant to> |

After the table a summarization of the paper must be included.

Then list all the contributions the paper asserts, notes, and category solutions where this research is applied.
