# Solutions

Might make a table later showing how they compare against each other on certain properties.

- [Example](./example.md)

## Solution Template

Each solution must start with a table:

Title | \<Solution Title> |
---|---|
Designers | /<linked github handles> |
Data Representation | \<Link to Data Representation Category Solution>[] |
Replica Structure | \<Link to Replica Structure Category Solution>[] |
Access Control | \<Link to Access Control Category Solution>[] |
Replication | \<Link to Replication Category Solution>[] |

Summarize how everything fits together, pros/cons, and compare with other solutions.
